### Lesson: Keeping Smart Contracts Secure

In this lesson, we will discuss the importance of upgrading, maintaining, monitoring, and implementing incident response for smart contracts to ensure their long-term security.

#### 6.1 Upgrading and Maintaining Smart Contracts

To keep your smart contracts secure, it's essential to keep them up-to-date with the latest versions of the Solidity compiler and other tools, as well as to apply any necessary patches or improvements.

**Code snippet: Update pragma to the latest compiler version**
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```
#### 6.2 Monitoring Smart Contracts
Monitoring your smart contracts can help you detect suspicious activity or potential vulnerabilities.

Code snippet: Implement logging with events

```solidity
event Deposit(address indexed sender, uint256 amount);

function deposit() public payable {
    emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
}
```

#### 6.3 Incident Response
In the event of a security incident, such as a vulnerability being exploited or an attack on your smart contracts, it's crucial to have an incident response plan in place. One way to respond to an incident is by implementing a "circuit breaker" or "pause" mechanism in your smart contract.

Code snippet: Implement a circuit breaker
```solidity
contract CircuitBreaker {
    bool public stopped = false;
    address public owner;

    modifier onlyOwner {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function.");
        _;
    }

    modifier stopInEmergency {
        require(!stopped, "Circuit breaker is active.");
        _;
    }

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function toggleCircuitBreaker() public onlyOwner {
        stopped = !stopped;
    }

    // Other functions protected by the `stopInEmergency` modifier
}
```
