# Introduction to Layer 1 Blockchains

In this unit, we will explore the foundational technology behind cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin: Layer 1 blockchains. These blockchains serve as the underlying infrastructure that powers various decentralized applications (dApps), financial services, and smart contracts.

## What are Layer 1 Blockchains?

Layer 1 blockchains, also known as base layer blockchains, are the core protocol that facilitates the creation, validation, and storage of transactions within a decentralized network. They ensure security, consensus, and immutability through a combination of cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, and consensus algorithms.

### Key Concepts

1. **Consensus Mechanisms:** The methods by which a decentralized network of nodes comes to an agreement on the state of the blockchain. Examples include Proof of Work (used by Bitcoin) and Proof of Stake (used by Ethereum 2.0).

2. **Decentralization:** The distribution of control and decision-making across a network of participants, eliminating the need for a central authority.

3. **Smart Contracts:** Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, enabling automatic execution when predefined conditions are met.

## Ethereum and Bitcoin

In this unit, we will focus on two prominent Layer 1 blockchains:

1. [**Ethereum:**](https://github.com/joinpursuit/pursuit-crypto-lessons/blob/main/case_studies/layer_1/eth.md) A decentralized, open-source blockchain that features smart contract functionality. Ethereum serves as the foundation for numerous dApps and has played a critical role in the growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

2. [**Bitcoin:**](https://github.com/joinpursuit/pursuit-crypto-lessons/blob/main/case_studies/layer_1/bitcoin.md) The first-ever cryptocurrency and blockchain, introduced by the pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is primarily used as a digital store of value and a means of transferring value across its decentralized network.
