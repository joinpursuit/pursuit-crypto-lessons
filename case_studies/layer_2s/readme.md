## What are Layer 2 scaling solutions?

Layer 2 scaling solutions are off-chain solutions that aim to improve the scalability of blockchain networks. By moving some of the processing off the main chain, Layer 2 solutions can increase the transaction throughput of the network, while reducing the fees and the time required to process transactions.

## How do Layer 2 solutions work?

Layer 2 solutions use different methods to achieve scalability, but they all involve moving some of the processing off the main chain. Some popular Layer 2 solutions include:

- Sidechains: separate blockchain networks that are interoperable with the main chain
- State channels: off-chain channels that allow multiple transactions to be processed without requiring each transaction to be processed on the main chain
- Plasma: a hierarchical structure of sidechains that can be used to process high-volume, low-value transactions
- Rollups: a technique for bundling multiple transactions into a single transaction, reducing the number of transactions that need to be processed on the main chain

## Popular Layer 2 platforms

There are several popular Layer 2 platforms, including:

- [Polygon](https://github.com/joinpursuit/pursuit-crypto-lessons/tree/main/case_studies/layer_2s/polygon): a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, formerly known as Matic Network
- Arbitrum: a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that uses optimistic rollups
- [Optimism](https://github.com/joinpursuit/pursuit-crypto-lessons/blob/main/case_studies/layer_2s/optimism.md): a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that uses optimistic rollups
- Binance Smart Chain: a separate blockchain network that is interoperable with the main Binance Chain network

## Use cases for Layer 2 solutions

Layer 2 solutions have a wide range of potential use cases, including:

- Improving the scalability and speed of blockchain-based games and applications
- Reducing the cost and increasing the speed of transactions on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
- Enabling micropayments and other low-value transactions that would be too expensive to process on the main chain
- Facilitating cross-chain interoperability between different blockchain networks

The possibilities are endless, and we are only starting to see the potential of Layer 2 scaling solutions.
