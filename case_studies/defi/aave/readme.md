## Overview of Aave

### Introduction to Aave

Aave is a decentralized, open-source, and non-custodial lending and borrowing platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to earn interest on their deposited assets and borrow assets against their deposited collateral. Aave has become a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem due to its innovative features, such as flash loans and credit delegation, and its support for a wide range of digital assets.

### History and Development

Aave was founded by Stani Kulechov in 2017 under the name ETHLend before rebranding to Aave in 2018. The protocol's mainnet launch took place in January 2020. Aave has since undergone several upgrades, with the most significant being the transition to Aave V2 in December 2020, introducing new features and improving the platform's overall user experience.

### Aave's Native Token: AAVE

AAVE is the native governance token of the Aave platform. AAVE token holders can participate in the protocol's governance by proposing and voting on changes, such as adding new assets or adjusting interest rate models. Additionally, users can stake their AAVE tokens to earn rewards and secure the protocol as a safety module.
