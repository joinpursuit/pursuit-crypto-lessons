# Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Explainer

Testing text of changes, or DeFi, is a new financial system that is built on decentralized technologies like blockchain. DeFi aims to provide an open, transparent, and accessible alternative to traditional financial systems, allowing anyone to participate in financial activities like lending, borrowing, trading, and investing, without the need for intermediaries like banks or brokers.

## Popular DeFi Protocols

In this course, we'll be diving into some of the most popular DeFi protocols and tools:

### [Uniswap](https://github.com/joinpursuit/pursuit-crypto-lessons/tree/main/case_studies/defi/uniswap)
Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade Ethereum-based tokens without the need for intermediaries. Uniswap uses an automated market maker (AMM) model to determine prices, which means that users can trade tokens without needing to match buyers with sellers.

### [AAVE](https://github.com/joinpursuit/pursuit-crypto-lessons/tree/main/case_studies/defi/aave)
AAVE is a decentralized lending platform that allows users to borrow and lend cryptocurrency without the need for intermediaries. Users can earn interest on their crypto holdings by depositing them into lending pools, or they can borrow funds at lower rates than traditional lenders.

### [Compound](https://github.com/joinpursuit/pursuit-crypto-lessons/tree/main/case_studies/defi/compund)
Compound is another lending and borrowing platform that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings and borrow funds at competitive rates. Compound uses a unique algorithm to determine interest rates and incentivizes users to supply liquidity to the platform.
