## Overview of Compound

### Introduction to Compound

Compound is a decentralized, open-source, and non-custodial lending and borrowing platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to supply and borrow a variety of digital assets, earning interest on supplied assets while paying interest on borrowed assets. As one of the first and most popular DeFi protocols, Compound has played a crucial role in shaping the DeFi landscape.

### History and Development

Compound was founded by Robert Leshner and Geoffrey Hayes in 2017. The protocol's mainnet launch took place in September 2018, and it has since grown into one of the largest DeFi platforms in terms of total value locked (TVL). In June 2020, Compound introduced its native governance token, COMP, further decentralizing the platform's governance and decision-making processes.

### Compound's Native Token: COMP

COMP is the native governance token of the Compound platform. COMP token holders can participate in the protocol's governance by proposing and voting on changes, such as adding new assets, adjusting interest rate models, or modifying platform parameters. Additionally, users can earn COMP tokens by interacting with the protocol, as the tokens are distributed to both lenders and borrowers.
