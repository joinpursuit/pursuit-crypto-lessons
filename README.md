# Pursuit Crypto - Post Core Learning

The curriculum is separated into several modules:

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Fundamentals](https://github.com/joinpursuit/pursuit-crypto-lessons/tree/main/fundamentals) | In this module, fellows will learn about the layers of Web 3, consensus algorithms (Proof of Work/Proof of Stake), the history of crypto(so far), and learn the fundamentals of being a Blockchain Developer |
| Case Study Series | This module will dive into real world use cases of Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrency |
| Software Development | In this module, fellows will learn about languages and frameworks such as Solidity (smart contract language), Web3.js, Ethers.js, Truffle, Ganache, Hardhat, React/Javascript, and JSON RPC. They will also work on various projects, including an NFT Collection Project, IPFS, PINATA, ERC-721, a DApp Project with ERC-20 contract, and an interoperability project. |

## Technical / Computer Science

### Layers of Web 3
- Layer 0: Peer-to-peer (p2p) internet overlay protocols 
- Layer 1: Zero/low trust interaction protocols (Bitcoin/Ethereum) 
- Layer 2: Oracles, Computation, etc. 
- Layer 3: Developer APIs and Languages 
- Layer 4: Applications 
- Layers 0 - 2 only need to be understood at a high level. The real meat and potatoes is around intimate understanding of Layer 3-4.

### Consensus Algorithms
- Proof of Work/Proof of Stake

### Economics & A little bit of Crypto History / Understanding the Space
- Understanding the history and current economic systems
- The incentive for Satoshi to create Bitcoin
- Why "trustless" transactions are potentially better than our current financial system
- How money is used as an "instrument of change"
- Three generations of Cryptocurrencies

### Case Study Series
- Olympus DAO 
- Helium 
- Uniswap 
- Polkadot 
- ENS 
- Chainlink
- Polygon
- Decentraland 
- Solona

### Software Development
- Languages & Frameworks: Solidity (Smart Contract Language), Web3.js, Ethers.js (JavaScript packages that communicate with DApp frontends), Truffle, Ganache, Hardhat (Local Development environments that allow you to run a local blockchain), React/Javascript 
- Understanding JSON RPC
- Projects: NFT Collection Project, IPFS, PINATA, ERC-721, DApp Project with ERC-20 contract (Making their own De-Fi protocol), Interoperability project (Wrapping Tokens, Crosschain transfers)  

## Economics & Crypto History

### Understanding the Space
- Understanding the history and current economic systems
- The incentive for Satoshi to create Bitcoin
- Why "trustless" transactions are potentially better than our current financial system
- How money is used as an "instrument of change"
- Three generations of Cryptocurrencies

### Important Events to Study
- The DAO Hack
- Bitcoin's Inflation Hack
- Polygon's Hack
- The "split" between the founders of Ethereum
- The creation of Bitcoin Cash

### Case Study Series
- Olympus DAO 
- Helium 
- Uniswap
