# Introduction to Web3 and Cryptography

## Overview

In this lesson, you will be introduced to Web3 and Cryptography. You will learn what Web3 is, how it differs from Web2, how cryptography works, and why it is important for building decentralized applications.

## What is Web3?

Web3 is the next generation of the internet that is built on decentralized technologies such as blockchain. Unlike Web2, which relies on centralized servers, Web3 uses peer-to-peer networks and smart contracts to create a more open, transparent, and user-controlled web. Web3 enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that can run on a peer-to-peer network without intermediaries.

To better understand Web3, we recommend reading the following books:

- "Mastering Blockchain: Distributed ledger technology, decentralization, and smart contracts explained" by Imran Bashir
- "The Infinite Machine: How an Army of Crypto-hackers Is Building the Next Internet with Ethereum" by Camila Russo

For more in-depth information on Web3, we recommend listening to the following podcasts:

- "Epicenter" by Meher Roy and Brian Fabian Crain
- "Unchained" by Laura Shin

## Cryptography

Cryptography is the practice of secure communication in the presence of third parties. It is used to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data. Cryptography is an essential component of blockchain technology and is used to secure transactions, protect private keys, and ensure the immutability of data.

To learn more about cryptography, we recommend reading the following book:

- "Cryptography Engineering: Design Principles and Practical Applications" by Niels Ferguson, Bruce Schneier, and Tadayoshi Kohno

The diagrams above illustrates how Web3 differs from Web2. In Web2, data is stored on centralized servers and controlled by intermediaries such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon. In Web3, data is stored on a decentralized network of computers and controlled by smart contracts that execute code automatically. This enables developers to build dApps that can run on a peer-to-peer network without intermediaries.

## Why is Web3 and Cryptography Important?

Web3 and cryptography are important for building decentralized applications that can run on a peer-to-peer network without intermediaries. Decentralized applications can provide greater security, privacy, and autonomy for users, and can help to reduce costs and increase efficiency in various industries. With Web3, users can control their data and identity, and participate in a more open and transparent internet.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you have learned about the basics of Web3 and cryptography. Understanding these concepts is essential for anyone interested in building decentralized applications on the blockchain. By reading books and listening to podcasts, you can gain a deeper understanding of these topics and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the space.
