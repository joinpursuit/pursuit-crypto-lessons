# Lab 2: Exploring DApps and Interacting with MetaMask

In this lab, you will explore various popular DApps and learn how to interact with them using your MetaMask wallet. This hands-on experience will help you understand how DApps work and familiarize you with the process of using a blockchain wallet to interact with a DApp.

## Requirements

1. A computer with an internet connection.
2. The [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/download.html) installed and connected to a test network like Rinkeby or Ropsten.
3. A MetaMask account set up with some test Ether in its balance. You can obtain test Ether from a faucet like [Rinkeby Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) if you're using the Rinkeby test network.

## Instructions

1. **Select DApps to explore(see below)**: Choose at least three different DApps to explore. You can find a list of popular DApps on websites like [State of the DApps](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/) or [DApp Radar](https://dappradar.com/). Look for DApps that are compatible with the test network you're using in MetaMask.

2. **Visit the DApp website**: Go to the website of each DApp you've selected. Some DApps may require you to switch to a specific test network, such as Rinkeby or Ropsten, in MetaMask. If that's the case, make sure to switch to the appropriate network.

3. **Connect your MetaMask wallet**: Most DApps will prompt you to connect your MetaMask wallet when you first visit the site. If not, look for a "Connect Wallet" or similar button on the DApp's user interface. Click on the button to connect your MetaMask wallet to the DApp.

4. **Explore the DApp's features**: Spend some time exploring the features and functionalities of each DApp. Try out different actions such as sending transactions, interacting with smart contracts, or participating in the DApp's ecosystem. Make sure to use your test Ether for any transactions or interactions that require Ether.

5. **Document your experience**: While exploring each DApp, take notes about your experience. Consider the following aspects:

   - User interface and overall user experience
   - Types of transactions and interactions supported by the DApp
   - How the DApp leverages the advantages of blockchain technology
   - Any challenges or difficulties you encountered while using the DApp

6. **Disconnect your MetaMask wallet**: Once you've finished exploring a DApp, disconnect your MetaMask wallet from the DApp. You can usually find a "Disconnect Wallet" or similar button in the DApp's user interface. Alternatively, you can disconnect the DApp directly from the MetaMask extension by clicking on the connected site in the extension and selecting "Disconnect."

7. **Repeat the process**: Repeat steps 1-6 for each DApp you've chosen to explore.

## Example DApps to Explore

Here are some popular DApps to explore on Ethereum test networks. Please note that the availability of these DApps on different test networks may vary. Always check the DApp's documentation for compatibility with the test network you're using in MetaMask.
