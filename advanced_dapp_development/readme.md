## What are DApps on Ethereum?

Decentralized applications (DApps) on Ethereum are software applications that run on the Ethereum blockchain, using smart contracts to execute code in a decentralized and trustless manner. Ethereum is the most popular blockchain platform for building DApps, with a large ecosystem of tools and developers, and it supports a wide range of use cases.

## How do DApps on Ethereum work?

DApps on Ethereum are composed of two main components: the frontend user interface and the backend smart contracts that execute the application logic. The frontend is usually built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it communicates with the Ethereum network via a software library called a Web3 provider.

The backend smart contracts are written in a programming language like Solidity or Vyper and are deployed on the Ethereum network as part of a smart contract transaction. Once deployed, the smart contracts can be interacted with using a Web3 provider or a specialized DApp browser like MetaMask.
